# Project Name: Backend and Frontend Data Analysis Dashboard

This is a full-stack web application that combines backend services with a frontend dashboard for data analysis and visualization. The backend handles user authentication, data processing, and provides APIs for the frontend. The frontend displays user data and visualizations using charts.

## Project Description

This project consists of two parts:

1. **Backend**: A server built using Python, Flask, or Django (depending on your implementation), which serves API endpoints and handles user authentication, CRUD operations, and data analysis.
2. **Frontend**: A React-based dashboard that consumes data from the backend and visualizes it using charts (like bar charts, line charts, etc.).

The purpose of this project is to provide a data visualization dashboard where users can sign up, log in, and view different analytical insights from data collected and processed by the backend.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: 
  - Python (Flask/Django)
  - SQLAlchemy (for database interaction)
  - JWT (for authentication)
  - Flask-RESTful or Django REST framework (for building APIs)
  - Pandas/NumPy (for data analysis)

- **Frontend**:
  - React
  - Chart.js or Recharts (for data visualization)
  - Axios (for API requests)

- **Database**: 
  - PostgreSQL or SQLite (depending on your choice)

- **Authentication**:
  - JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

- **Version Control**:
  - Git, GitHub

## Setup and Installation

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/SAKSHIRAJPUTT/backend_app.git
   cd backend_app
   
2. Set up a virtual environment:
   python -m venv venv
  
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
   
   - On macOS/Linux:
     source venv/bin/activate
    

4. Install the required dependencies:


   pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Set up environment variables for application (e.g., database URL, JWT secret):

   - Create a `.env` file in the root of the project with the necessary variables. Example:

     FLASK_APP=app.py
     FLASK_ENV=development
     SECRET_KEY=<your-secret-key>
     DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/database_name
 

6. Run the backend server:

   python app.py  
 

7. The backend server will be running on `http://localhost:5000` (or the configured port).

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:


   cd frontend
 

2. Install the frontend dependencies:

   npm install


3. Run the frontend server:

   npm start
  

4. The frontend will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. **Start the backend**: Ensure that your backend is running and listening for requests.
2. **Start the frontend**: Run `npm start` in the `frontend` directory to launch the React application.
3. Visit `http://localhost:3000` to interact with the dashboard. The app will fetch data from the backend API and display it in visual charts.

### Notes:

- This README assumes a typical stack setup for backend and frontend with JWT authentication and data visualization via React. You can modify it based on your actual project setup.
- If you're using a different setup for the backend (e.g., Django or Node.js), make sure to adjust the instructions accordingly.

Let me know if you need further adjustments or details added to the README!
